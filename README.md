Claude is running your GTM and your leads live in CSVs. Spreadsheets fall apart around 30 deals in: you lose track of who said what, what's open, and what's next. CRMs solve that, but they were built for humans clicking through UIs, not agents reading and writing it on your behalf.

Plug Claude into your CRM via MCP and the schema torches your context, every action is a network round-trip, and you blow through your usage limits. Salesforce and HubSpot are shipping their own CLIs, but they end at the deal record — the scrapes, enrichment runs, and half-cleaned lists that fed it live somewhere else. You can't replay how a deal moved through stages, see what your last scrape pulled in and what it didn't clean up, or pick up where last weekend's list-building session left off.

Agents work best on files. Agent CRM is a portable `.acrm` file your agent can query, edit, diff, and version — pipeline, scrapes, and enrichments, all in one place.

## What's in a `.acrm` file?

A `.acrm` file is a **SQLite database** with a [change-history layer](https://lix.dev) on top. That means:

- **No proprietary format.** Open it with any SQLite client (`sqlite3 pipeline.acrm`) and your data is right there in standard tables.
- **Every write is a versioned checkpoint.** Like git for your CRM — branch to run an experiment, diff to see what changed, revert if Claude mangles a row.
- **It's just a file.** Copy it, email it, commit it, sync it through Google Drive. No server, no account, no migration tool needed if you ever walk away.

If you can read SQLite, you can read your CRM. That's the whole guarantee.

## Quickstart

Install the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @agent-crm/cli
```

Create your first `.acrm` file and let Claude rip on it:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Create an .acrm file

```bash
acrm init pipeline.acrm
```

Then import your CSVs

```bash
acrm import csv ./leads.csv
```

And query the file any time with:

```bash
acrm execute "select * from people limit 5;"
```

## Why Agent CRM
- **🧩 Headless:** Ships as a CLI.
- **⚒️ Skills based:** Claude writes skills against the CLI (transcript ingestion, stale-deal sweeps, weekly reports) as `.md` files.
- **🧱 Modeled:** uses Attio's data model out of the box. Typed, related, queryable with plain SQL. Fixed schema = predictable agent edits.
- **🔀 Version controlled:** every change is a checkpoint on a branch. Diff, merge, revert, time-travel.


## Stateful skills for GTM

Skills are how Claude does the work. Bring your own, or use the ones we ship — `prep-call`, `post-call`, `follow-up`, `stale-opportunities`, `champion-left`, `new-hire-trigger`. Claude can write new ones in seconds.

**[`prep-call`](.claude/skills/prep-call.md).** Before a meeting, Claude pulls the person's full history from your `.acrm`, fetches their LinkedIn profile (cached, 14-day TTL), and hands you a one-pager with discovery questions tied to what they've actually been talking about.

**[`post-call`](.claude/skills/post-call.md).** After a meeting, Claude pulls the transcript from Granola, resolves the person in `.acrm`, extracts the problem + would-pay signal, and writes a `last_call` value plus any deal-stage update via `acrm execute`. You review the SQL output before the next sync.

**[`follow-up`](.claude/skills/follow-up.md).** Claude queries `.acrm` for leads with stale activity, reads the prior thread for each, and drafts the next message in your tone of voice. You review and send.

**[`stale-opportunities`](.claude/skills/stale-opportunities.md).** Run nightly. Claude finds deals stuck in qualified/proposal for 60+ days, re-enriches the primary contact via Apollo, scans for new ICP-matched hires and news signals at the account, and writes back a status (`actionable` / `dead` / `needs_review`) with a one-line narrative so AEs can triage in seconds.

**[`champion-left`](.claude/skills/champion-left.md).** Run biweekly. Claude scans open pipeline for primary contacts whose Apollo employment record changed in the last 14 days and DMs the assigned AE the affected deals, departure dates, and the champion's new employer — so you can pivot to a new contact before the deal goes cold.

**[`new-hire-trigger`](.claude/skills/new-hire-trigger.md).** Run monthly. Claude searches Apollo for ICP-matched executives (VP Sales, CRO, Head of RevOps, etc.) hired in the last 30 days at your ABM accounts, flags the ones with open pipeline, and surfaces a re-engagement list — a new buyer often resets a stalled deal.

Each skill is a markdown file in `.claude/skills/`. Here's what `post-call` looks like:

```markdown
---
description: Pull a Granola transcript, resolve the person in .acrm, and log the call via SQL — using the CLI's three commands: init, import csv, execute.
---

## Steps

1. **Resolve the person** with a SQL lookup against `pipeline.acrm`:
   `acrm execute "SELECT DISTINCT record_id FROM acrm_value WHERE object_slug = 'people' AND attribute_slug = 'email_addresses' AND active_until IS NULL AND normalized_key = ?" '["<email>"]' --json`

2. **Find the Granola meeting** via `mcp__granola__list_meetings`. Filter
   to meetings where the person's name appears in the title or
   participants. If multiple, ask the user to pick.

3. **Fetch the transcript** with `mcp__granola__get_meeting_transcript`.

4. **Extract the call fields** (problem, would-pay, next steps).

5. **Write back via `acrm execute`.** Close the previous `last_call`
   value (`UPDATE acrm_value SET active_until = …`) and insert a new
   one. Update the deal's `stage` the same way if it moved.

6. **Report a short summary.** The user reviews the JSON output.
